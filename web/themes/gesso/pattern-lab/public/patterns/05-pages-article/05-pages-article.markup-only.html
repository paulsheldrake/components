      <p>You're the Dread Pirate Roberts, admit it. How many do you think you could handle? You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept. But how can you be sure? Will this do? You truly love each other and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the story books say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will. You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is "never get involved in a land war in Asia" - but only slightly less well-known is this: "Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line"! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha...</p>
<p>They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder. Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa... which I have. Move? You're alive. If you want I can fly. You just shook your head... doesn't that make you happy? Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. Probably he means no *harm*.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely. And YOU: friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless! Do you want me to send you back to where you were? Unemployed, in Greenland? No, there is too much. Let me sum up. Buttercup is marry Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour. So all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape... after I kill Count Rugen. You seem a decent fellow... I hate to kill you. You seem a decent fellow... I hate to die. Naturally... but I find that Thibault cancels out Capa Ferro. Don't you?</p>
